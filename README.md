HOTEL ROOM BOOKING SYSTEM

A basic hotel room booking system which allows user to add, update and view room details like room name, price, and customer name. The data is stored in an array and displayed on the webpage, meaning no server-side storage or database integration.

FEATURES:
    View all rooms
    Edit and Delete details
    Book a room for any customer
    Add new room

CURRENT LIMITATIONS:
    Data is stored temporarily in a javascript array.
    Form validation only for customer name.
    The UI is basic and can be improved with front-end frameworks.


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
    Implement backend storage like MySql or MongoDB.
    Add form validation for every input fields instead of just required.
    Improve UI/UX with front-end frameworks like Bootstrap or React.
    Allow multiple bookings per room and implement room availability checks.
