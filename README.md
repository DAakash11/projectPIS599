HOTEL ROOM BOOKING SYSTEM

A basic hotel room booking system which allows user to add, update and view room details like room name, price, and customer name. The data is stored in database and displayed on the webpage, meaning easy server-side storage and database integration. Also successfully deployed in azure vm with ip 51.104.6.37, which can be accessed from anywhere.

FEATURES:
    View all rooms
    Edit and Delete details
    Book a room for any customer
    Add new room

CURRENT LIMITATIONS:
    Data is stored temporarily in a javascript array. (overcame using MongoDB)
    Form validation only for customer name.
    The UI is basic and can be improved with front-end frameworks.


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
    Add form validation for every input field instead of just required.
    Improve UI/UX with front-end frameworks like Bootstrap or React.
    Allow multiple bookings per room and implement room availability checks.
